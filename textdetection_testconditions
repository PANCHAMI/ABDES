Common cases:
1 : Text present in q.n diagram succesfully matched to text present in training data.
2 : All points are not mapped to unique Clusters.---> recursion, after finding smallest distant to the cluster,check the cluster include 3 or 2 points,
if there are only 2 simply added to the cluster, else create another method
in which call the same cluster claasification method excluding previous cluster
#### 3 : A particular point is not included in the cluster
4 : Points mis mapped to another cluster[in wrong order placed]
#### 5 : All points are unmatched

Case 1: (Point count equal)
1.1 : Call to 1
1.2 : call to 2
1.3 : call to 3
1.4 : call to 4
1.5 : call to 5

Case 2: (Point count lesser)
2.1 : Call to 1 and still missing some blocks.
2.2 : call to 2
2.3 : call to 3
2.4 : call to 4
2.5 : call to 5

Case 3: (Point count greater)--->setting a threshold, when do classification calculate smallest distance and check that it is beyond threshold, if yes remove that poin
3.1 : call to 1 but some points are extra
3.2 : call to 2
3.3 : call to 3
3.4 : call to 4
3.5 : call to 5
3.6 : points that are not part of a cluster containing the text.
