Case 1: (Point count equal)
1.1 : Successfull match. all Good.
1.2 : Not all points mapped to unique clusters (one point in one cluster mapping not happend)
1.3 : getCluster methord not returned a cluster for a particular point.
1.4 : Point miss mapped to another clusters (extream case!!)
1.5 : all points are unmatched

Case 2: (Point count lesser)
2.1 : Successfull match for the points in QN figure, still missing some blocks.
2.2 : Not all points mapped to unique clusters (one point in one cluster mapping not happend)
2.3 : getCluster methord not returned a cluster for a particular point.
2.4 : Point miss mapped to another clusters (extream case!!)
2.5 : all points are unmatched

Case 3: (Point count greater)
3.1 : Sucessfully matched, but some points are extra
3.2 : Not all points mapped to unique clusters (one point in one cluster mapping not happend)
3.3 : getCluster methord not returned a cluster for a particular point.
3.4 : Point miss mapped to another clusters (extream case!!)
3.5 : all points are unmatched
3.6 : points that are not part of a cluster containg the text.



common:

3.1 : Sucessfully matched
3.3 : getCluster methord not returned a cluster for a particular point.
3.5 : all points are unmatched
